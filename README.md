# 07-node-async_file_io

## Requirements

Create a JavaScript file to act as a Node.js program named `async.js`. This program
should work exactly the same as the previous exercise. However you cannot use a
synchronous method.

Optional: create a second file named `08.json` for your program to read.

Example:

```json
{
  "languages": {
    "JavaScript": "Awesome",
    "C++": "Difficult",
    "BASIC": "Old"
  }
}
```

Expected:

```bash
$ ./08.js 08.json
{
  "languages": {
    "JavaScript": "Awesome",
    "C++": "Difficult",
    "BASIC": "Old"
  }
}

```
